# pytauargus

Statistical disclosure control (SDC) for tabular data, as a Python package and
a headless `tauargus` command. Protect tables directly from DataFrames with
`protect()`, or run legacy Tau-Argus 4.1 `.arb` batch files without the GUI.
The engine solves with the open-source
[HiGHS](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS) solver. Part of
[tauargus-engine](https://github.com/trygu/tauargus-engine).

## Install

```bash
pip install pytauargus
tauargus --version
```

Wheels bundle HiGHS and the native engine; no other installation is needed.
Available for Python 3.10-3.13 on macOS arm64, Linux x86_64 and aarch64 (manylinux_2_28) and
Windows x64. Other platforms: build from source (see the repository).

## Cloud native

Built to run unattended in containers, CI and batch services:

- **Headless:** no GUI, no display, no interactive prompts.
- **Self-contained:** one `pip install`; the solver (HiGHS) and native libraries
  are bundled in the wheel. No licensed solver, license server, system packages
  or Windows registry.
- **Stateless:** input and output are plain files in the working directory;
  scratch files go to the system temp directory.
- **Scriptable:** success is exit code 0; errors go to stderr with a non-zero
  exit code.
- **Portable:** wheels for Linux (manylinux_2_28, so any glibc 2.28+ image such
  as `python:3.x-slim`), macOS arm64 and Windows x64.

A ready-made image is published to GitHub Container Registry with each release
(linux/amd64 and linux/arm64):

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/work ghcr.io/trygu/tauargus-engine run batch.arb
```

Pin a version with `ghcr.io/trygu/tauargus-engine:0.3.0`. To build your own image:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir pytauargus
WORKDIR /work
ENTRYPOINT ["tauargus"]
```

## What problem it solves

Publishing a table can disclose information about individual respondents: a
cell with few contributors, or one dominated by a single contributor. Such
*primary* cells are suppressed, but totals would still reveal them, so *secondary*
cells are suppressed as well, chosen to minimise information loss. Alternatively
the table can be controlled-rounded. `tauargus` does this from a batch file.

## Quick start

### From a DataFrame

`protect()` is available from version 0.3.0. Install with
`pip install "pytauargus[dataframe]>=0.3.0"` to include pandas support.
For a source checkout, follow the
[source-build instructions](../../README.md#building-from-source),
then run `uv sync --extra dataframe` here.

```python
import pandas as pd
from pytauargus import protect

micro = pd.DataFrame({
    "Region": ["North"] * 6 + ["South"] * 6,
    "Sector": ["Retail"] * 3 + ["Services"] * 3
              + ["Retail"] * 3 + ["Services"] * 3,
    "Turnover": [100., 5., 5., 10., 10., 10., 20., 20., 20., 30., 30., 30.],
})
result = protect(
    micro, ["Region", "Sector"], response="Turnover",
    safety_rules="NK(2,75)", suppress="OPT(1)", workdir="tauargus_run",
)
table = result.tables[0]
publication = table.dataframe()[["Region", "Sector"]].copy()
publication["Turnover"] = table.safe()
publication.to_csv("protected.csv", index=False)
print(publication)
```

Each row is one respondent. `NK(2,75)` flags cells whose two largest
contributors exceed 75% of the response. The engine computes the crossing
and totals, identifies primary unsafe cells, and adds secondary suppression.
`protect()` coordinates microdata, metadata, batch generation and result parsing.

Pandas is optional for the core API: column dicts, lists of row dicts and
polars DataFrames are accepted too. `dataframe()` returns a pandas DataFrame
when available, otherwise polars, otherwise a list of row dicts.
Column labels become strings and must remain unique after conversion. Column
dicts require equal lengths; row dicts use the ordered union of all keys, with
missing fields represented by `None`.

### Existing batch files

Put the data (`.asc`), its metadata (`.rda`) and a batch file in one folder.
Paths in a batch file are relative to the working directory.

```text
<OPENMICRODATA> "tau_testW.asc"
<OPENMETADATA>  "tau_testW.rda"
<SPECIFYTABLE>  "Size""Region"|"Var2"||
<SAFETYRULE>    NK(2,75)|NK(0,0)
<READMICRODATA>
<SUPPRESS>      MOD(1)
<WRITETABLE>    (1,3,AS-,"safe-table.txt")
```

```bash
tauargus run demo.arb
```

This reads the microdata, builds the Size x Region table of `Var2`, flags cells
failing the dominance rule `NK(2,75)` (two largest contributors may not make up
more than 75 %), applies secondary suppression with the modular method, and
writes the protected table as code/value pairs, with suppressed values masked.
The sample inputs are in the repository's
[data/](../../data/) folder.

## Batch file commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `<OPENMICRODATA>` / `<OPENTABLEDATA>` | Input data file (microdata or a ready table) |
| `<OPENMETADATA>` | `.rda` metadata describing the file layout and variables |
| `<SPECIFYTABLE>` | Explanatory variables, response, shadow and cost variables |
| `<SAFETYRULE>` | Sensitivity rules, e.g. `P(p,n)`, `NK(n,k)`, `FREQ(min,safety)` |
| `<READMICRODATA>` / `<READTABLE>` | Build or read the tables |
| `<RECODE>` | Recode a variable, e.g. via a `.grc` file |
| `<SUPPRESS>` | Protection method: `GH`, `MOD`, `OPT`, `NET`, `RND` (rounding), `CTA` |
| `<WRITETABLE>` | Export: `(TabNo,Type,Options,"file")`; types 1 CSV, 2 pivot CSV, 3 code/value, 4 SBS, 5 intermediate, 6 JJ |
| `<SOLVER>` | Accepted for compatibility; only HiGHS is used. Other names log a warning |
| `<LOGBOOK>` | Write a log file |

The grammar and parameters follow the legacy Tau-Argus 4.1 manual.

## Command line

```bash
tauargus run      batch.arb   # execute the whole batch
tauargus explore  batch.arb   # load data + metadata, list variables
tauargus compute  batch.arb   # table computation only
tauargus suppress batch.arb   # compute, then apply suppression
tauargus round    batch.arb   # compute, then round
tauargus audit    batch.arb   # feasibility intervals of suppressed cells
tauargus save     batch.arb   # compute, then write tables
tauargus tables   batch.arb   # print a table summary
tauargus version
```

Exit code is 0 on success and non-zero on an error, with a message on stderr,
so it fits into scripts and pipelines.

## Audit (Intervalle)

A suppressed cell has a range of values it could take while staying consistent
with the published totals — its **realized lower/upper bounds**, the
*feasibility interval*. Protection requires sufficient uncertainty to meet the
configured protection requirements. A narrow interval can reveal the original
value or constrain it too closely; interval width alone does not establish
protection. The audit checks for insufficient protection.

In legacy Tau-Argus this ran in a **separate** `intervalle.exe` (standalone
Delphi/Pascal executable); Tau-Argus wrote a `.JJ` file, launched it externally
and read the intervals back. The rewrite ports that logic into the engine
(`TauAuditJj` in the `csp` module), so it runs in-process over a temporary
`.JJ` file with nothing external to install:

```python
from pytauargus.engine import run_batch

engine = run_batch("demo.arb")
rows = engine.audit(0)   # one dict per suppressed cell:
# {"cell", "min", "max", "value", "status", "unsafe"}
```

The realized bounds are stored on the table (readable via `get_table_cell`).
`tauargus save demo.arb --audit --format intermediate` writes the legacy
INTERMEDIATE (type-5) audit file with the realized-interval columns.

## Python API

### DataFrame protection

```python
from pytauargus import protect, ProtectResult, TableResult

# Multiple tables; scalar options are recycled across them.
result = protect(
    micro, [["Region", "Sector"], ["Region"]], response="Turnover",
    safety_rules="NK(2,75)", suppress="OPT(1)", workdir="multi_table_run",
)
assert isinstance(result, ProtectResult)
assert all(isinstance(table, TableResult) for table in result.tables)
```

| Argument | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `tables` | A flat list of explanatory names for one table; a nested list for several |
| `response` | Required numeric response column; a scalar or one name per table |
| `safety_rules` | A rule string or per-table list; `None` supplies no rules |
| `suppress` | Default `"OPT(1)"`; use `"MOD(1)"` for modular suppression. A single string gets each table's correct number |
| `run=False` | Write `.asc`, `.rda`, `.arb` and return planned output paths without running the engine |
| `workdir` | Retained directory, resolved from the caller's working directory; returned paths are absolute. Defaults to a new temporary directory |

Explanatory and response names must be unique within each table. The magnitude
result reserves `freq`, `cost`, `status`, `lower` and `upper` for diagnostics;
rename colliding source columns before calling `protect()`. Invalid names and
suppression sequences whose length is neither 1 nor the table count raise
`ValueError` before any input files are written.

Metadata and table options include `weight_var`, `weighted`, `holding_var`,
`decimals`, `hrc`, `totcode`, `missing` and `codelist`; see `help(protect)`.
The high-level API requires a numeric response column; frequency-only tables
using the batch `<freq>` response use the lower-level API.

`ProtectResult` contains `.tables` in input order, `.engine` after the batch,
`.files` (`asc`, `rda`, `arb`, `tab1`, …) and `.workdir`. With `run=False`,
`.tables` is empty and `.engine` is `None`; the planned `.tab` files are not
created by that call. Files persist so callers can inspect them and choose
when to remove them.

| `TableResult` accessor | Returns |
|------------------------|---------|
| `safe(unsafe_marker="x")` | Response values with primary `U` and secondary `M` cells masked |
| `status()` | One `S`, `U`, `P`, `M` or `E` symbol per cell |
| `unsafe()` | Original, unmasked responses for analysis |
| `dataframe()` | Full diagnostic rows, including original responses |
| `n_cells`, `columns`, `rows`, `response` | Result shape, rows and response name |

Use the explanatory columns plus `safe()` to construct the publication table,
as in the quickstart. `dataframe()` does not mask the response automatically.
`safe(None)` uses missing values instead of `x`.

Audit is explicit and engine indices are zero-based:

```python
rows = result.engine.audit(0)  # realized min/max and insufficient-protection flag
result.engine.write_intermediate_table(0, "audit.tab", with_audit=True)
```

The `lower` / `upper` columns in the default result are protection levels;
realized bounds are returned by `audit()`. `TableResult` is a parsed snapshot
and does not refresh when the engine is audited or modified. Raw intermediates
and audit reports contain original values and belong with analyst artifacts.
The list-of-dicts fallback from `dataframe()` is a defensive copy, so editing
it does not change the result's subsequent `safe()` or `status()` values.

### Existing batches and individual commands

```python
from pytauargus.engine import run_batch

engine = run_batch("demo.arb")   # parse and execute; returns the Engine
```

Lower-level pieces: `pytauargus.batch.parse_batch(path)` returns the parsed
command list, and `pytauargus.engine.Engine` executes commands one at a time.

## Generating batch inputs

`pytauargus` also *writes* the batch inputs, as a port of
[rtauargus](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/rtauargus), so it emits the exact
formats the engine reads:

```python
from pytauargus.arb import micro_arb

micro_arb(
    asc_filename="donnees.asc",
    explanatory_vars=[["REGION"], ["SEXE"]],
    response_var="CA",
    safety_rules=["NK(1,85)", "FREQ(3,10)"],
    suppress="GH(.,100)",
    output_names=["tab1.csv", "tab2.csv"],
    output_type="1",  # CSV; the generator default is SBS/type 4
)
```

`pytauargus.micro.micro_asc_rda` writes the fixed-width `.asc` file and its
`.rda` metadata. `micro_arb` references those files and writes a `.arb` batch.
`pytauargus.hrc.write_hrc` writes `.hrc` hierarchy files; the separate
`pytauargus.rda.write_rda` writer handles metadata text. `protect()` coordinates
these steps automatically; `protect(..., run=False)` previews the complete
generated pipeline without running it.

## Example notebooks

`notebooks/` contains three **executed, output-saved** notebooks that double
as API documentation (every code cell runs against the verified public API):

| Notebook | Covers |
|----------|--------|
| [`01_quickstart`](notebooks/01_quickstart.ipynb) | DataFrame → `protect()` → `TableResult` → masked CSV, then metadata and existing batches |
| [`02_protection_and_audit`](notebooks/02_protection_and_audit.ipynb) | OPT/MOD DataFrame protection, explicit audit and masked export; batch OPT/MOD/RND |
| [`03_generators`](notebooks/03_generators.ipynb) | `run=False` file preview, multiple tables, individual writers and custom batch round-trip |

Run them interactively, or headless (the same command CI could use).
The `notebooks` extra includes pandas for the DataFrame examples:

```bash
# interactive
uv sync --extra notebooks
uv run --with jupyterlab jupyter lab notebooks/

# headless: execute every notebook and re-save its outputs
uv run --with nbclient --with nbformat --with ipykernel python notebooks/_run.py
```

`uv run --with nbclient --with nbformat --with ipykernel pytest -k notebooks`
executes them as tests too (the test skips when `nbclient` is absent, so the
default `uv run pytest` gate stays dependency-free).
